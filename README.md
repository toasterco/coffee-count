coffee-count
============

Toaster Dev teams simple coffee tracker.

## What is it?

An attempt to collect daily statistics on cofee intake, which we will represent and graph in the future. Toaster Ltd. developers can track their collective intake using this Meteor hack.

## Why can't I use it?

If you havn't been authorised to update the Meteor collections yet just PR adding your github username to the list of current cylons.
